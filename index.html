                <p>My name is Brendan Doherty, I'm a computer programming and web development student at BMCC. </p>
                
                    
                <p> Although, I'm pursing this degree, it's actually not my passion. 
                    It's out of job security. I think that more people will need to learn how to code and it will 
                    become apart of many careers in the future. I was recently admitted into Baruch College. At Baruch 
                    I will be studying Journalism.
