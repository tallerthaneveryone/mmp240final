                <p>My name is Brendan Doherty, I'm a computer programming and web development student at BMCC. </p>
                <p> I also work full time for a large startup in the health and wellness industry. In my day job, 
                    I'm a care manager. I have a team of 7 associates who directly report to me. It's a challenge 
                    to work full time and go to school full time, but I see this as an adventure and one that will
                    have many positive outcomes.
                </p>
                <p> Although, I'm pursing this degree, it's actually not my passion. 
                    It's out of job security. I think that more people will need to learn how to code and it will 
                    become apart of many careers in the future. I was recently admitted into Baruch College. At Baruch 
                    I will be studying Journalism.
